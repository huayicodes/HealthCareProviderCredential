# HealthCareProviderCredential
I explored Random Forest Classification in a highly imbalanced dataset (Health Care Provider Credentials).

The dataset can be found at: https://data.wa.gov/Health/Health-Care-Provider-Credential-Data/qxh8-f4bd
I access the dataset on 09/25/2019. As the dataset is updated daily, it could be different from what I used for this analysis.

For project details, please refer to the descriptions in the Jupyter Notebook "HCPCred".
